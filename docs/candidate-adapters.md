# Candidate adapter authoring

Bench evaluates Candidates, not one vendor's Agent type. A Candidate may be a
coding agent, another automated system, or a deterministic tool. It joins Bench
through a Candidate adapter: create a local package, publish the same package as
an OCI artifact, or export a CandidateLock from either source. Adding a
Candidate does not require a product-specific branch in Bench.

The current adapter wire format reuses `a3s.asset.v1`, `category = "agent"` so
Candidate and Judge packages can share resolution, snapshotting, and Runtime
machinery. This is a packaging contract, not a requirement that the underlying
Candidate was built with A3S.

## Package contract

A minimal local package has this shape:

```text
my-agent/
├── .a3s/
│   └── asset.acl
├── run.sh
└── prompts/
    └── controller.md
```

```acl
version = "a3s.asset.v1"
category = "agent"
kind = "tool"
name = "my-agent"

source {
  package_path   = "."
  entrypoint     = "run.sh"
  definition_path = "prompts/controller.md"
}
```

Paths are normalized package-relative paths. Absolute paths, `..`, symlinks,
hard links, and special files are rejected during validation or snapshotting.
The entrypoint and definition must be part of the immutable package.
For a model-backed Candidate, the definition frontmatter must declare
`max_steps` between 1 and 1000. Bench uses this locked value as the maximum tool
round count; long-horizon adapters should choose it deliberately.

## Two execution forms

An executable Candidate omits `--model`. Its entrypoint receives the private
workspace path as its first argument:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -eu
workspace=$1
# Read and modify only "$workspace".
```

The current development Docker path runs this entrypoint without network access
or model-provider credentials. It is suitable for deterministic tools and for
adapters whose complete dependencies are already in the locked work image. It
is not a safe way to run a host-installed Codex or Claude Code CLI.

A model-backed Candidate supplies `--model`. Bench reads the controller
instructions from `source.definition_path`, obtains the named provider/model
route from `.a3s/config.acl`, and keeps provider credentials on the host-owned
model client. The locked Candidate model also bootstraps the embedded A3S Code
agent, so an absent or invalid ambient `default_model` cannot replace or block
the benchmark model identity.

```bash
a3s bench run ./task \
  --agent a3s-code \
  --model openai/my-model
```

`a3s-code` is the model-backed controller bundled with the installed Bench
component. Its package includes `runtime.acl`, which binds the A3S Code Core
version and the planning, continuation, and delegation capability switches into
the Candidate revision. Local and OCI adapters use the same locking path. For
OCI-seeded Tasks, Bench also tells the controller that `workspace.oci.source_path`
has already been extracted as the editable workspace root. Task-provided public
fixtures elsewhere in the work image remain readable through the Bash sandbox,
while every deliverable write remains confined to `/workspace`.

The model-backed implementation above is a versioned A3S Code Core controller,
not the interactive CLI or TUI host. A controller prompt named after Codex or
Claude does not make it the Codex or Claude Code product.

The bundled `codex` adapter is a separate native product protocol. It invokes a
host-installed, already authenticated Codex CLI through `codex exec`, binds the
reported CLI version into CandidateLock v2, uses an ephemeral session, ignores
ambient user configuration and rules, and gives generated commands only the
benchmark workspace. Provider credentials remain owned by Codex and are not
copied into the adapter or lock.

```bash
codex login status
a3s bench run ./task --agent codex
a3s bench run ./task --agent codex --model <codex-model-id>
```

`--model` is passed directly to Codex for this adapter, so use a Codex model ID,
not an A3S `provider/model` route. Bench refuses locked execution after the
installed Codex CLI version changes; create a new CandidateLock so comparisons
remain attributable to an exact product version.

## Lock before comparing

Create one TaskLock and one CandidateLock per exact adapter/model combination:

```bash
a3s bench advanced task lock ./task --out ./task.lock.json
a3s bench advanced candidate lock ./my-agent \
  --model openai/my-model \
  --out ./my-agent.candidate.lock.json

a3s bench run ./task.lock.json \
  --agent ./my-agent.candidate.lock.json \
  --locked
```

Use distinct Candidate adapter revisions to compare complete coding-agent
products. Use one adapter revision with different model bindings to isolate
model behavior. In both cases, run the CandidateLocks against the same TaskLock.

## OCI publication

The package can be stored in any OCI Distribution-compatible registry. Bench
accepts Docker-compatible images containing `/.a3s/asset.acl` and generic OCI
artifacts pulled with ORAS:

```bash
a3s bench advanced candidate lock \
  oci://registry.example.com/agents/my-agent:1 \
  --model openai/my-model \
  --out ./my-agent.candidate.lock.json
```

A mutable tag is only a source selector. Lock creation records the resolved OCI
manifest and canonical package content; locked execution never follows the tag.
