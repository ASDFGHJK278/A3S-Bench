# Built-in Tasks

Built-ins are ordinary a3s-bench TaskBundles with task-owned A3S Judge Agent
Assets. They are entries in one global catalog, not separate benchmark
products, runtimes, or command namespaces.

## User Interface

A locally available built-in is referenced by its bare task ID:

~~~bash
a3s bench run quick_file_edit --agent ./candidate
~~~

A bare ID searches locally available built-ins only. It never searches local
paths, A3S OS, or upstream source names. Local TaskBundles are
explicit and begin with `./` or `../`:

~~~bash
a3s bench run ./tasks/smoke --agent a3s-code --model openai/example
~~~

The catalog commands are:

~~~bash
a3s bench list                              # locally runnable tasks
a3s bench list --all                        # also include locally blocked records
a3s bench info TASK_ID                      # runnable task details
a3s bench info college_english_exam_bank        # model-Judge requirements
~~~

`info <id> --all` is read-only catalog inspection. It does not turn a blocked
record into a runnable task reference, pull its image, resolve credentials, or
create project state.

There are no source-specific selectors, CLIs, protocols, state directories,
or runtime versions. Immutable identity comes from the compiled TaskLock and
the task-owned Judge AssetSnapshot, not from the readable task ID.

## Admission

Local availability and official admission are separate catalog dimensions.
`availability = "ready"` permits a local `local_unofficial` run. A blocked task
appears only with `list --all` and fails before an OCI pull or billable work.
`admission = "quarantined"` prevents an official result, but does not by itself
prevent local execution.

Admission requires a signed record binding:

- the exact TaskBundle and Judge Agent AssetSnapshot;
- immutable dependency and OCI manifest digests;
- the `bench.judge.v1` capability and typed request/result schemas;
- A3S OS Runtime isolation, protected mounts, and result-channel behavior;
- network, ModelGateway, secret, resource, and timeout capabilities;
- licenses, provenance, and required execution evidence.

The signer must chain to an A3S admission trust root distributed by the signed
top-level `a3s` release. The record also binds the RuntimeSemanticsProfile,
measurement cohort, privacy policy, validity interval, admission schema, and
signer role. The installed Bench component carries a signed revocation
snapshot; an expired, revoked, unknown-key, mismatched, or malformed record is
not admitted.

Task authors, Judge manifests, local catalog edits, environment variables,
operator configuration, and Advanced commands may deny a task but cannot
create, extend, replace, or promote official admission. A portable-valid local
Task may run only as `local_unofficial`, and its result cannot claim built-in or
official status. Updating signed A3S trust/component material is the only P1
path to a new official admission.

Runtime capability advertisement alone is not execution admission. An official
run also requires signed provider-build conformance to the admitted
RuntimeSemanticsProfile and a per-execution attestation binding build,
placement, spec, and result. An operator-trusted development provider may run a
local Task, but the result remains `local_unofficial`.

The short `quick_file_edit` task is available as a local conformance check. It
exercises the complete run pipeline without requiring a long-horizon agent run.

The 51 third-party task sources currently in this catalog are all quarantined
for official results. Forty-six are locally available as long-horizon tasks;
five are locally blocked because their referenced OCI revisions have incomplete
dependency, toolchain, locked-package, or scoring-asset contents.
Their source records publish OCI tags and legacy evaluator commands, but do not
provide enough evidence to admit those commands as A3S Judge Agent Assets. The
image layers are referenced, not included or republished by this repository.
`college_english_exam_bank` requires a configured `bench.judge_model` route.
Bench passes that route to its task-owned Judge without copying credentials into
locks or results, and binds the route name into TaskLock and Judge identity.

This is an incomplete development snapshot, not a fixed catalog or an
acceptable released set. The current 51 sources are provisional: entries may be
added, removed, replaced, or revised as their provenance and execution
contracts are validated. Admission and availability are both per Task
revision. A locally blocked revision does not block unrelated available
revisions.

Every Task revision that is shipped as a built-in must still be genuinely out
of the box. Release preparation must resolve immutable work and Judge OCI
manifests, provide any required protected hidden input, adapt legacy evaluator
output to `bench.judge.result.v1`, validate the complete Task/Judge supply
chain, and attach the required admission and Runtime-conformance evidence.
Normal first use may pull those locked OCI artifacts, but users must not clone
an upstream dataset, run the import tool, construct a Judge, place a hidden
bundle, edit the catalog, or log in to A3S OS when using the local Runtime.

Once a revision is locally available, it becomes visible in the default `list`
and its bare ID works with the normal command:

~~~bash
a3s bench run TASK_ID --agent asset:acme/reviewer
~~~

The task still owns the Judge and users cannot provide a replacement. Candidate
and Judge are both standard `a3s.asset.v1`, `category = "agent"` assets. The
A3S OS Runtime executes their locked snapshots with candidate and Judge role
policies; Bench does not provide another Agent Runtime.

An ordinary runnable TaskBundle that needs local hidden data supplies it at
`private/bundle/`. If an authored Task intentionally needs none, it may omit
that directory and its TaskLock records the canonical empty-tree digest; Git
does not need to preserve an empty directory. The 51 imported adapters keep
evaluator-owned data inside their referenced Judge OCI images rather than
copying it into this repository. Their catalog entries use
`admission_reason = "official_evidence_incomplete"` until the complete official
evidence chain is available.

`catalog.json` contains discovery fields only. Source repositories, revisions,
source-file digests, adaptations, and generated-file digests live under
`provenance/`. Source-specific importers are maintainer tools; source names do
not become public task selectors or runtime concepts.

Built-in payloads remain in the private lazy Bench control component and are
not copied into the current project. `list` and `info` are read-only. Any locks,
runs, evidence, results, and reports created by `run` use the one project state
root:

~~~text
<project>/.a3s/bench/
~~~

The location of a built-in or local TaskBundle never changes that root.

## Maintenance

To reproduce the current third-party conversion from pinned local source
repositories:

~~~bash
python3 tools/import_edgebench.py \
  --dataset-dir /path/to/task-dataset \
  --harness-dir /path/to/evaluation-harness
python3 tools/check_builtins.py
~~~

The importer refuses unexpected source revisions, merges into the global
catalog without overwriting tasks owned by another source, and never contacts
an OCI registry. The checker verifies catalog identity, generated digests,
standard A3S Agent Asset fields, quarantine state, generic naming, provenance,
licenses, and forbidden paths.
