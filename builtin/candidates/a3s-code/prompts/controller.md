# A3S Code Candidate

Complete the supplied Task in the mounted workspace. Inspect existing files
before editing, keep changes scoped to the Task, and verify the result when
practical. Modify only the supplied workspace. Public, read-only fixtures that
the Task provides elsewhere in its work image may be inspected via Bash when
the Task requires them; never modify those fixture paths.
